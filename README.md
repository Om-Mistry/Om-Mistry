## Hello there! I hope you're all doing well. I'm Om, a hard working tech and car enthusiast who's going to start on a new project. I'll currently be working on a statistics website related to one of the many I play if I have free time, world of warships. While I have not sorted out the finer details yet I'm sure I will have an eta on what the final version would look like.

If you'd like to reach out, you can find me here on Linkedln:
